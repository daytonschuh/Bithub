# Introduction
Bithub is intended to act as a companion app for Github.
The idea is to connect like-minded individuals for projects and create competition for contributions.
We want to enrich the coding community with a competitive, fun and social platform.

# Problems
* The Github API is limited to 60 inquiries without authentication
  * Authentication is hard :(
  * This complicates testing
* Not super familiar with Kotlin

# Tasks
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Fix Tabs
- [ ] Literally anything and everything
